## 📋 Preparation Steps
• Review their stated pain points and urgency drivers
• Understand their decision-making process and timeline
• Prepare value justification tied to their specific needs
• Research their company's recent financial performance and priorities

## 💰 Pricing Strategy
• Lead with value, not price - emphasize ROI and business impact

• Offer pilot or phased implementation to reduce risk
• Prepare bundle options and tiered pricing structures

## 🔧 Implementation Terms
• Clearly define scope and deliverables with specific milestones
• Set realistic timelines with buffer for contingencies
• Include success metrics and KPIs that align with their goals
• Define support levels and response times

## ⚖️ Risk Mitigation
• Address their specific concerns upfront with concrete solutions
• Offer guarantees or service level agreements where appropriate
• Provide references from similar companies in their industry
• Include termination clauses that are fair to both parties

## 🤝 Closing Tactics
• Create urgency with limited-time incentives or bonuses
• Start with smaller scope to build trust and demonstrate value
• Get agreement on next steps and decision timeline
• Prepare for common objections with data-driven responses

## 📝 Key Contract Terms to Negotiate
• Payment schedules that align with value delivery
• Intellectual property rights and data ownership
• Liability limitations and indemnification clauses
• Change management and scope adjustment procedures

*This is a strategic framework. For specific contract terms and legal language, consult with your legal team.*`;
